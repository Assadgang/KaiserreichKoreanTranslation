lat.9.t:0 "The Wind Blows"
lat.9.d:0 "When the Second Weltkrieg began, the loss of the Baltic German birthright ironically became a sigh of relief. The two states, Latvia and Estonia, served as a neutral bulwark which protected Riga from the full force of the Russian invasion. Despite this, however, the Riga defense forces and their commanders were very well aware that this was merely a brief calm before the storm. Patrols in the surroundings of the city became more frequent, supplies are being stored and secured, a system of food rationing implemented for the average citizens.\n\nAnd then, the first signs came. Increasing Latvian military movement in the surroundings of the city, sometimes even in the range of Rigan artillery outposts - although the German troops opted to not fire upon them just yet. Enemy artillery stationed in the surroundings of the city, preparing to bombard hastily assembled barricades and fortifications. Utter silence from Latvian diplomacy, as if they have forgotten that Riga exists entirely.\n\nBoth sides had something to finish from their last engagements in 1936. The Latvians - to evict the Germans from their homeland at last, to reclaim Riga, their one and only capital. The Baltic Germans - to destroy this insurgency for good, and reclaim their birthright.\n\nA chilling wind blows across the streets of Riga, and with it, follows a barrage of yells, all shouting the same thing."
lat.9.a:0 "To the barricades!"

### Ideas ###

LAT_dualism:0 "이중 지배"
LAT_dualism_desc:0 "라트비아 공화국은 독일의 재앙에 대항하는 취약한 동맹에 참여한 두 조직과 두 야심가들 사이에서 태어났습니다. 라트비아 게릴라들은 라트비아를 위해 싸웠지만, 그들이 생각하는 라트비아는 사람마다 다릅니다. 어떤 이들은 인정된 지도자 아래에 국가적이고 애국적인 국가를 원하며, 다른 이들은 사회주의적인 이스콜라트(Iskolat)를 우러러봅니다. 이제 독일인들은 쫓겨났기 때문에, 이런 차이점들은 그들 스스로 무너지게 합니다."

LAT_remember_riga:0 "Latvieši, neaizmirstiet Rīgu!"
LAT_remember_riga_desc:0 "The beating heart of Latvia, its eternal capital, has been stolen away from us - our partisans have failed to secure the city and a “Free City of Riga” now stands on its soil, a constant reminder that our fight with the Baltic Germans is not yet finished. Latvians, never forget Riga!"
