### Leaders ###
POLITICS_AZIZ_JBS_DESC:0 "아마도 사우드 빈 압둘아지즈가 압둘아지즈 이븐 사우드 에미르의 분노에 휘말린 것은 잔혹한 운명이었을 것입니다. 사우드 빈 압둘아지즈는 이상하고 끔찍한 일들에 낯설어하지 않았습니다. 어린 에미르는, 외가 알 사브한 가문의 간계로 10살의 나이에 즉위했습니다. 어릴 적 그는 유명한 영국인 탐험가 윌리엄 셰익스피어의 이름에 담긴 유머도, 그리고 그의 죽음이 세계대전 동안 라시드 가문에 그 어떤 동맹도 없게 할 것을 알지 못한 채, 그의 죽음을 지켜봤습니다. 잦은 분쟁과 영국의 맥심 소총에 라시드 군이 스러지고, 조카의 배신에도 불구하고 라시드 가문은 생존했습니다. 이내 그는 호위타트(Howietat)의 지도자인 쿠웨이트 에미르와 거래하여 상호 보호를 얻어냈고, 네지드와 불안정한 평화를 구축했습니다. 이제 이 에미르는 성장했고 폭력과 배신을 통해 아라비아를 더 밝은 미래로 이끌 준비가 되어 있습니다."
POLITICS_ABDULAZIZ_JBS_DESC:0 "20살밖에 되지 않은 순진한 사우드 빈 압둘아지즈에게서 태어난 압둘아지즈 빈 사우드는 아버지가 성장했던 혹독한 텐트 생활을 알지 못했습니다. 압둘아지즈가 군 복무를 해야 할 때가 다가오자, 그는 대신 여행을 떠나기로 택했습니다. 말에 탄 무명 전사로서 망명 생활을 하며, 그는 이집트와 콘스탄티노플에서 전쟁이 세계를 바꾸고 있음을 관찰했습니다. 그가 헤일에 돌아왔을 때 그는 전통 의상을 입지 않고, 독일에서 주문한 멋있는 검은색 제복을 입고 있었습니다. 이제 사우드 빈 압둘아지즈는 죽었습니다. 그의 아들은 가문을 위해 복수하고 영원히 사우드 가문의 원수를 끝장내기로 결심했습니다."
POLITICS_GHAZI_DESC:0 "고 파이잘 빈 후세인의 외동아들인 가지(Ghazi)는 헤자즈의 투르크군으로부터 피하기 위해 사촌 자이드 빈 후세인과 엘 에사에 숨었습니다. 엘 에사에서 가지는 로렌스 반란군의 잔당들을 돌봤지만, 영국의 재정 지원은 1926년에 중단되었습니다. 이로써 가지는 호위타트(Howietat)에게 오스만 군대로부터의 보호를 요청해야 했습니다. 호위타트가 자발 샤마르로의 가입을 허락받자, 라시드와 하심 사이에는 일시적인 휴전이 맺어졌습니다. 가지의 이름이 가지는 영향력은 자유를 갈망하는 베두인족 사이에서 아직 강력하며, 아랍 혁명의 유산 역시 그러합니다. 그렇기에, 그의 이름이 가지는 위대함을 되찾기 위해서는 오스만 제국의 몰락 후 메카로의 개선행진이 있어야 할 것입니다."
POLITICS_SAEED_DUBAI_DESC:0 "전쟁과 경쟁은 아라비아의 침체를 가져올 뿐이지만, 교역과 경제는 언젠가 회복될 것이다. 사이드 알 마크툼 에미르가 자리에 오르며 한 연설의 일부입니다. 그의 두바이 에미르 재임은 외교와 인민들에 대한 복지라는 면에서 가히 모범이 될만 합니다. 1920년대의 대학살로 사우드에게 복종한 후, 진주 사업이 실패하자 인도와의 경제적 연결을 강화했으며, 종국에는 평화 약속을 진행했습니다. 라시드나 하심보다 월등히 부유한 그의 왕조는 축복받은 것 같습니다."
POLITICS_SHAKBUT_JOR_DESC:0 "알 나히안 가문은 사우드-라시드 전쟁 한가운데 갇혀버렸습니다. 사우드가 그들의 도시로부터 잔인할 만큼이나 높은 세금을 걷고, 그들의 상업은 침체되었습니다. 이는 샤크벗 알 나히안이 서방의 경제학자들과 함께 회복을 위한 경제 계획을 만들어내도록 했습니다. 이 계획은 에미르들에게 제시되었고, 초기의 성공은 샤크벗의 선거를 준비하게 했습니다. 알 나히안 가문은 바니 야스라는 그의 선조들이 어떻게 해안으로 이주했고 거주하기 적당한 땅을 찾아냈는지 연설을 통해 이야기를 만들어냈습니다. 에미르 사이에 퍼진 샤크벗의 개인적인 명성은 대단하며, 오직 가족들의 책략에 의해서만 훼손되고 있습니다. 샤크벗은 그의 명성이 가문 내 정치의 간계로부터 스스로를 구해줄 수 있으리라 확신합니다."
POLITICS_ABTAN_JOR_DESC:0 "Atban was the one-time rival and now successor to the famous soldier and Sheikh Auda abu Tayi. When Auda's ambitons failed, he retreated from Aqab into the Al Nefud. The Howietat's livestock starved, wells were denied to them. In desperation Atban ibn Jazi choose to again put aside his rivalry for the sake of thier people and seek aid from the Rashids. This bid was successful, and Atban became the representative of the Howietat. Auda's and his reputations for joining the Arab Revolt and facing the harshest of the Turkish reprisals made Atban a surprisingly good candidate for Emir. Atban challenged the Emirs to live among their own, and was rewarded with cooperation."
POLITICS_SABAH_JOR_DESC:0 "The Emirs of Kuwait began the century by setting the Rashid Saud conflict in motion, and it has finally paid off for them with the ascension of Jabe Al Sabah. It was Jaber's father who gave the Sauds arms and men in 1906 to retake Riyadh, a decision that would come back to haunt his son. The Ikhwan, Ibn Sauds frenzied soldiers attacked Kuwait when the British left, leaving devestation along the 1st Ring Road. Al Sabah prostrated himself to the Rashids, who forgave him and announced their protection of Kuwait. Now the Sabah are owed favors from the Rashids accrued during wartime, who exchanged this debt for a promise to elect Jaber al Sabah. Jaber himself reminding the emirs that he was first into battle on his horse against the Sauds, and that he alone could lead the charge against the Ottomans."
POLITICS_SAUDI_DESC:0 "Abdulaziz Ibn Saud, the mortal rival of many dead men, now turns his sights towards Saud bin Abdulaziz. This rivalry began when the young Ibn Saud was ejected from his tent in Riyadh by the Rashids. Never a pawn of Emirs, ibn Saud's father rallied the destitute men of the coastal Emirates to the great goal of his dynasty, Wahhabism. The Rashids were then ejected at the cost of many men, including their only western ally. Ibn Saud himself started many a feud the 사우디s inherited, as he expressed hatred towards any Arab who turned their nose up towards Bedouins. This seed of anger had passed onto his men, who inherited his ferocity and may turn this youthful fury against him yet."
POLITICS_SULTAN_OTAIBI_DESC:0 "An illiterate member of the Otaibah Bedouin tribe, Sultan came to head the so-called Ikhwan which formed a considerable portion of the forces of the house of Saud. Believing in a divine duty to spread Sunni fundamentalism, Sultan was none to pleased when the house of Saud attempted to limit his ability to raid neighbouring countries. Sultan now takes up arms against both his old allies in the house of Saud and the wider heathen world."

ARA_Power_Struggle_desc_JBS:0 "Time has not been very kind to the House of Rashid. Losing most of their male family members at the hands of the Ibn Saud and suffering from continuous raids into their territory by the Ikhwan, the Rashidi federation of Emirs is cracking under the weight of the Wahhabists. Support by the Ottoman Empire is keeping our dominion on its feet however as their continued partnership and alliance with our Emir ensures his lands are safe. Further reinforced in 1925 when the former British protectorates of the Trucial States, Qatar and Bahrain were returned to Ottoman custody, ties with the Sultan are strong.\n\nNonetheless some have argued that this partnership is the only thing keeping our realm together and should disaster befall the Ottomans, Ibn Saud may see it as his destiny to unite the peninsula under his rule."
ARA_Power_Struggle_desc_SAU:0 "For years we have waited for the opportunity to unite the 아라비아 peninsula under the House of Saud. Sadly the Ottoman watchdogs did not sleep with both eyes closed and when the British Empire fell in 1925, they more than rewarded their 라시디 lapdogs for their "loyalty" during the Weltkrieg. As we were left with nothing, devoid of allies and territorial gains, Abdulaziz grew ever more restless and vengeful.\n\nSaud bin Abd Al-Aziz may be enjoying the support of his Ottoman allies but dark clouds are gathering on the horizon and should his powerful benefactor find himself occupied in internal matters, his pathetic armies will have the face the Ikhwans rage all on their own..."

Zealous religious warriors, they are not bound by loyalty to Ibn Saud but by allegiance to the strict morals of Islamic society. Renouncing all Western advances, the Ikwhan wish to purify the Islamic world of its decadence and unite all muslims in a single unitary state.\n\nNonetheless they are an unruly and barbaric force, slitting the throats of all male prisoners they encounter and fighting with swords and lances. This makes them a worthy asset however to Ibn Saud as their zealously and bloodthirstiness is used in their infamous raids on the territories of our neighbours."

Nominally we claim to be loyal to the Ottoman Sultan, though if he thinks he can push us around, he will find that it is not he who rules the desert but us Arabs.

The first group, including the Sauds, Duwaish, and Otaibi were deemed too rebellious to be loyal vassals to Jabal Shammar. The latter group, including the Al Nahyan, Hashimites and the Gadban of the Bani Lam, were more useful. Ibn Saud has decided to spare the families of the Emirs on the condition that they swear total alleigence to Jabal Shammar.

saud.1.d:0 "The Weltkrieg was one of many signs that we, the House of Saud, are destined the rule this land. In the hour of his greatest hubris, the Hashemites were abandoned by their infidel puppet masters and left for dead to the Turks and their puppet masters. While our inactivity in the war proved most fortuitous when it came time to avoid Ottoman retaliation, the decadent Turks hold no real sway over us. Now we bide our time, gathering warriors, money, and expertise to strike at the 라시디s, who think they can play both sides by accepting Hashemite warriors and pay lip service to the Porte, and finally unite Arabia under our flag!"

They were also one of the principle reasons we were able to succeed in defeating the other Arab states and assert 사우디 dominance in the region. However, the Ikhwan have always been a traditional group, highly religious, and vehemently against change and reform. They do not seem to understand that modernisation is necessary when ruling a nation. Normally, we can control any anger felt by the Ikhwan with promises that we won't modernise any more. However, it seems we've pushed them too far this time. Ikhwan soldiers have united under the leadership of Faisal Al Duwaish, an Ikhwan commander, who has declared that the 사우디s are unfit to rule Arabia. Many Ikhwan militia have risen up, and fighting has already begun..."
