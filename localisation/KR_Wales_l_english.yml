### Leaders ###

POLITICS_SAUNDERS_LEWIS_DESC:0 "Saunders Lewis is one of Wales' more notable figures for his poetry and other literary feats and being one of the founds of Plaid Cymru. Dissatisfied with Lewis Valentine's slow and pacifist approach, as well as his own failed leadership bid he left to form his own Welsh Home Rule Army. Rising to being one of the most wanted men in the Union for his small-scale political terrorism. Now elevated to power by his new overlords, Lewis will no doubt embark on implementing his dictatorial 'third way' ideology and enforcing a Welsh revival at the expense of English."
POLITICS_LEWIS_VALENTINE_DESC:0 "The original leader of Plaid Cymru, Valentine has led the group through various tumultous years, mostly as a small scale pressure group campaigning for the Welsh language to be used allowing it to dodge the various political crackdowns. While officially opposed to Saunders Lewis' violent actions, Valentine himself has partook in some of the more low-scale actions. Now in power, Valentine will no doubt pursue expansion of the Welsh language and the creation of a democratic republic for Wales."
POLITICS_CLEMENT_DAVIES_DESC:0 "A left-leaning liberal and one of the first to support the revolution, Davies now finds himself shepharding the new Welsh republic. While mostly ambivalent and vague on the issue of Welsh independence, Davies seems content to rule over the republic so as to protect his more leftist strand of liberalism and allow it to grow after the disastrous years of the Union."
