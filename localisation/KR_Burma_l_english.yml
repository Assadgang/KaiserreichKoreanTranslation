BRM_totalist_party:0 "Nagani Book Club"
BRM_totalist_party_long:0 "Nagani Book Club\n§gEstablished in the mid 30s, the Red Naga Book Club emerged as one of the eminent political cliques of the Burmese Student movement. It was originally founded by the leftist teacher Than Tun and the former student union president U Nu as a means to promote and distribute Burmese translations of Marxist and Syndicalist literatures. Over time, the book club grew more closely affiliated with militant nationalist groups and at Than Tun’s behest it embraced a more radical political outlook, emphasizing a synthesis between socialism, buddhism and Burmese nationalism, as well as adopting a more organized structure. Nagani has now risen from a mere study group to a well-read and well-armed quasi student militia, with Thakin Than Tun as its commander. It stands as one of the most extreme, as well as most authoritarian factions among the Student Movement.§!"
BRM_totalist_party2:0 "RFP"
BRM_totalist_party_long2:0 "Red Flag Party\n§gIn the wake of the Burmese revolution, many formerly banned and discredited leftist factions have emerged onto the political scene with new, legitimate platforms to spread their ideology through. The Red Naga Book Club is no exception, what once was a study group turned student militia has reorganized itself once more into a closely knit vanguardist party calling for the complete social and economic transformation of Burma into a “Totalist State”. Than Tun is an eager supporter of the Totalist Charter, although he has over time made his own adjustments and additions to the political doctrine, as to better suit it to Burma’s unique status as a largely feudal, formerly colonized nation.§!"
BRM_syndicalist_party:0 "Young Workers’ Union"
BRM_syndicalist_party_long:0 "Young Workers’ Union\n§gThe Burmese Oil Workers’ Union, founded in 1921, was the first major Burmese trade union and played a large role in the nation’s nascent labour movement prior to the declaration of the Rangoon Republic. Nationalist parties, primarily the GCBA were quick to make alliances with the trade unionists, but no major labour reforms were carried out before foreign economic exploitation saw a major clampdown on trade union activities. It was not until the 1930s, when a new generation of well educated Burmese youth entered the workforce, that the labour movement resurfaced, now radicalized by Syndicalism. In collaboration with the Burmese Student Movement, many old trade unionists returned to politics and helped found the “Young Workers’ Union”, expanding their operations to cover a wider array of industries and trades.§!"

burma.0.t:0 "전쟁으로 분단된 국가"
burma.0.d:0 "In 1921, when the Indian Revolution went into full swing, Burma was quick to follow. By 1925, independence had been de facto won with the Indian Civil War coming to a stalemate. Independence had been won but peace was far-off with the country in a quasi-civil war between the various minorities and the central government in Rangoon. In 1928, after a skirmish on the Siamese border, the Kingdom invaded and a year long bloody war followed. The Treaty of Moulmein, negotiated by Germany and Japan, brought an end to the conflict but ceded Lower Shan to Siam and left the occupation of Moulmein and lower Burma undecided. Humiliated, Chit Hlaing's GCBA government collapsed at the 1930 elections and U Ba Pe's Nationalist Party won in a tight victory. In the 1935, U Ba Pe and his reformed People's Party won another victory, against the backdrop of allegations of corruption and fraud. Since then, U Ba Pe has struggled to cement his rule against an increasingly radical and politically demanding populace. All the while, India waits for an opportunity to spread the revolution east. When the day comes, will Burma be ready?"
burma.0.a:0 "우리는 이러한 힘든 시기를 함께 이겨내야한다!"
burma.1.t:0 "랑군 대학으로부터의 폭동과 항쟁"
burma.1.d:0 "Dissatisfaction with corruption in the government, the immense patronage systems permeating civic life and U Ba Pe's unscrupulous rule, has sparked some of the greatest demonstrations seen in our country since independence was achieved in 1925. Stemming from the great and prestigious Rangoon University, radicalised leftist students have occupied several administrative buildings and held rallies denouncing the president and his wealthy backers as being corrupt and detrimental to the welfare of the nation. Still, the demonstrators haven't managed to garner the support of the industrial workers and rural farmers, restricting the budding movement to the intelligentsia."
burma.1.a:0 "지휘봉과 군도(날이 휘어진 무거운 검)를 보내라!" #sabre
burma.2.t:0 "랑군 대학으로부터의 폭동과 항쟁"
burma.2.d:0 "In neighbouring Burma, riots are spreading among a political impotent youth. Protesting against the rampant corruption at Rangoon University, lack of reform and the illegitimate rule of president U Ba Pe. For now the demonstrations have been restricted to Rangoon, but the inactivity of the current regime might spell another outburst in the months to come, especially with workers at the oil fields in Yenangyaung, Chauk, and Minbu rumbling about lousy pay and poor living conditions. Should the two fractions unite we might find ourselves with a friendly government on the other side of the Bay of Bengal."
burma.2.a:0 "버마인들을 계속 지켜봐라!"
burma.3.t:0 "예난자웅 유전에서의 파업"
burma.3.d:0 "예난자웅, 차우크, 그리고 민부 유전에서 일하는 노동자들은 부패한 정부와 그들의 낮은 생활 수준에 반대하며 심각한 파업을 시작했습니다.경찰과 예비군은 유전을 장악하고 붉은 깃발을 흔들며 반-사회주의적 노래를 부르는 시위자들을 몰아내는데 완전히 실패했습니다. 그들의 요구를 달랠 무언가를 제공하여, 나머지 지역에서의 추가적인 시위 확산을 막아야합니다."
burma.3.a:0 "건방진 녀석!! 노동자들의 움직임은 곧 붕괴될 것이다!"
burma.3.b:0 "그들을 달래기 위해 시도해보아라..."
burma.4.t:0 "랑군에서의 학생 시위!"
burma.4.d:0 "재앙입니다! 작년과 마찬가지로 랑군대 학생들은 대통령 지위에 대항해 시위를 일으켰습니다. 그러나 올해 급진적 학생 지도자들은 여전히 사회에 만연한 부패와 독재주의를 한탄하며 똑같은 불만을 품은 예낭자웅, 차우크, 민부의 유전 노동자들과 함께 시위에 동참하여 시위는 국가적 범위로 확산되었습니다. 시위자들이 물러서지 않고, 국가의 명예를 더럽힌다면, 오직 단호한 군사적 대응만이 문제를 해결할 수 있을 것입니다! "
burma.4.a:0 "상상할 수 없는 일이다, 군대를 보내 대학생들을 진압하라!"
burma.5.t:0 "시위대를 향해 발포 준비를 마친 군대"
burma.5.d:0 "영원할 것 같은 일이 있은 후, 시위는 마침내 랑군 대학교의 학생들과 버마 왕립군 사이의 분쟁으로 귀결되었습니다. 파업 중인 유전 노동자들의 행진이 수도를 향해 오고 있다는 정보가 현지 지휘관에게 전달되었고, 시위대를 날이 저물도록 해산시키지 못했기 때문에 시위대를 무슨 수를 써서도 해산시키라는 군 총참모부의 명령이 조금씩 내습니다. 버마의 운명은 촌각에 달려 있습니다... "
burma.5.a:0 "...그러나 군대는 혁명에 가담하여 군주정을 타도했다!"
burma.5.b:0 "...그리고 군대는 제대로 발포했다!"
burma.6.t:0 "버마 사회주의 공화국을 선언하다"
burma.6.d:0 "와바페의 위법적인 공화국은 학생, 노동자, 군사의 연합에 의해 강제로 퇴위되었습니다. 사회민주주의 정부가 새로운 개혁의 시대를 열 것입니다. 허나 우리 사회의 미래는 아직 일부 지도자 손에 있습니다. U Ottama의 지휘 아래, 다시 말해 벵갈, 오리사, 아삼의 캘커타 정부 아래에서의 인도와의 재통합에 대한 논쟁이 야당에서 열리고있다. 국회는 결정을 내릴 시간이 다가온다.. "
burma.6.a:0 "우리는 캘커타의 동지와 독자적으로 살 것이다!"
burma.6.b:0 "U Ottoma가 옳다 인도 연방에 가입을 희망한다."
burma.6.c:0 "고립은 과거부터 우리를 지켜주었으며 미래에도 당연히 그럴 것이다!"
burma.7.t:0 "버마 사회주의 공화국의 선언"
burma.7.d:0 "In Burma, the corrupt U Ba Pe presidency has been toppled by a coalition of protesting workers, students and an army refusing to carry out the order to massacre the latter's peaceful demonstrations. Power now resides with a provisional Burmese government, still infant in its position and beleaguered to the East by a hostile Siam. Intimidated by the prospect of a possible renewed war with the Bangkok-based Chakri monarchy intervening on the side of the disenfranchised landowners, this new Burmese constellation has approached us with an offer of alliance, securing themselves against foreign involvement and gaining us a secure border to the East. Calcutta will have to answer swiftly and unequivocally lest this opportunity slip out of our hands."
burma.7.a:0 "환영하네 군대와 사회주의자 동지들!"
burma.7.b:0 "버마는 대륙의 냄새나는 겨드랑이에 불과하다"
burma.8.t:0 "인도 연방에 가입한 버마 공화국"
burma.8.d:0 "In Burma, the corrupt U Ba Pe presidency has been toppled by a coalition of protesting workers, students and an army refusing to carry out the order to massacre the latter's peaceful demonstrations. Power now resides with a provisional Burmese government, still infant in its position and beleaguered to the East by a hostile Siam. Within said new government, a faction led by U Ottoma has taken absolute control and has begun arguing for a reunification of the Burmese state with the naturally legal heir to the British Raj, namely our revolutionary Calcutta. A sizeable part of the Burmese state agrees with the proposition, hoping that united under one red banner we may obtain emancipation - not only for the workers and peasants of the Bengal, Orissa, Assam and Burma - but for all of India's oppressed working men and women. The cabinet will have to make its decision swiftly, lest popular support for this union evaporate."
burma.8.a:0 "우리는 그들과 함께 할 것이며, 함께 저항할 것이다!"
burma.8.b:0 "우리는 그들과 동맹이 되는 것이 좋을 것이다."
burma.8.c:0 "우리는 그들의 갈등과 아무런 상관이 없다."
